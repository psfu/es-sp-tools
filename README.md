### Installation:
* download the zip file in the dist folder.
* undeploy the zip file in ./plugins in folder of Elasticsearch, and then it will create a folder named "sp-tools". (please remove the zip file, if the zip file is also in ./plugins)
*  modify sp-tools/plugin-descriptor.properties, change the elasticsearch.version to you elasticsearch version 
* * EX: elasticsearch.version=5.5.1 (this is tested in 5.5 and 5.4)

<pre>
# the key of the roles for the permissions, using it like this: _sp/auther/stop?key=admin
admin.adminKey=admin
# the key of the roles for the permissions, using it like this: _sp/auther/stop?key=admin 
admin.userKey=go
#the simple seed, which using for authentication with cookie
auth.seed=33024
#switch the logger
logger.using=true;
#switch the auther
auther.using=true;
</pre>
* finished.

### Details
* the cookie is using an simple algorithm, which is changes every time when be generated by the seed, and the algorithm is very fast to validate, since it's very simple :)
* the ES do not add the remote IP info in the Http request in the version of 5.4.x and previous, and we may get it from the channel of Netty. ... 

### ToDo:
* complete the document
* add validation functions
* add authentication fonction with user
* separate the console to a single project
* import the utils of Shui from the project of Waterwave
